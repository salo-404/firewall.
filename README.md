🔒 Spring4Shell Firewall Defense - Cybersecurity Incident Simulation This project is part of a Cybersecurity Job Simulation I completed in August 2025 through Forage. It focuses on detecting, analyzing, and mitigating a simulated real-world cyberattack involving the Spring4Shell (CVE-2022-22965) vulnerability 
🔐 Cybersecurity Job Simulation – Incident Response & Firewall Project
This project was developed as part of a Cybersecurity Job Simulation completed through Forage. The simulation provided a realistic scenario involving a simulated malware attack, requiring me to think and act like a security analyst.

✅ What I Did:
Analyzed a simulated Spring4Shell (CVE-2022-22965) attack targeting a vulnerable endpoint

Identified suspicious payloads and attack patterns in POST requests and headers

Wrote a custom Python-based firewall (firewall_server.py) to detect and block malicious activity

Produced a complete incident postmortem, documenting the impact, detection, root cause, resolution, and action items

💡 What I Gained:
Practical experience in threat detection and defensive scripting

A deeper understanding of incident response workflows

Insight into real-world vulnerability exploitation and mitigation

This project demonstrates how I applied foundational cybersecurity skills to a realistic threat scenario. It reflects my ability to both analyze and respond to attacks using technical solutions.
